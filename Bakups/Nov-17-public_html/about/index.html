        <div id="first-paragraph"><p>Thank you for stopping by! I'm Charles McLaughlin Piché, an independent SEO Consultant, musician and traveler.</p>
<br />
<p>This website <a href="/blog/a-new-lifestyle-and-the-beginning-of-seocharles" title="A new lifestyle and the beginning of SEOCharles">was launched in 2012</a> after I decided to sell everything and <a href="/blog/who-inspired-me-to-sell-everything-and-move-to-spain" title="Who inspired me to sell everything and move to Spain">move to Spain</a>. I have since then lived in 5 different countries, helped dozens of clients with their SEO, and recently re-established myself in one of my favorite city: Québec.</p></div>

                <h3>How I got into SEO?</h3>
                <p>As with most things that last, SEO chose me more than I chose it. It started back in 2003 when a client I designed a website for asked me to get him ranked in this new thing called Google.</p>
<p>Curiosity led to multiple hours reading forums and experimenting with this new thing called search engine optimization.</p>
<p>Less than a year later, this client business nearly doubled and they stopped giving 30k / year to Yellow Pages for print ads. This was the beginning of my SEO journey.</p>
<h3>Who I work with?</h3>
<p>I work with business owners, agencies, in-house SEOs, marketing directors and their teams.</p>

<h3>What Others are Saying</h3>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p>"Charles is superb and I recommend him highly whenever I'm talking to other entrepreneurs and the subject of SEO comes up. He is friendly, professional and reliable, and I've found him to be a pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>More importantly, he gets results. Instead of resorting to shady short-sighted SEO tricks, Charles takes a long-term view and aims to improve a website both for the human visitor and the search engines. As a result our site is now easier to navigate and gets the most valuable content in front of our visitors more effectively - and Google has taken note!</p>
<p>We've seen our organic traffic rise steadily and significantly since hiring Charles, and with the ongoing strategies he has recommended I have no doubt this will continue."<br />Christopher Sutton, <a href="http://www.easyeartraining.com" title="Ear Training">Easy Ear Training</a></p>

<h3>Lifestyle Business</h3>
<p><img src="/images/about/working-in-thailand_250x333.jpg"  width="250"  height="333" alt="Working in Thailand" class="wrapright"/></p>
<p>The idea with SEOCharles was to create a business around my interests and on my own terms. Over the last 4 years, it led me to live in 5 different countries, live amazing experiences, and meet amazing people.</p>
<p>In 2016, it was time to re-assess my priorities, interests and what living on my own terms meant. This led me to re-established myself close to family and get on projects (more to come) that were not possible with my previous situation.</p>
