            <h4>Testimonial</h4>
            <p><i>"Charles has taken several of my high trafficked money sites and converted them from HTTP to HTTPS.  I was nervous about the switch because I know if it's not done right there could be a drop in rankings/traffic, but it was smooth and turned out to be a great decision.  I've continued to refer other website owners to his HTTPS conversion service and all of them have high praise."</i><br />Jeff Root, SellTermLife.com</p>
