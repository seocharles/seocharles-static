In early April 2012, I made a decision that led to major changes in my life. Whithin about a week, I sold the majority of my stuff, transferred my lease, and booked a one-way flight to Barcelona.

Looking at it from Barcelona four months later, I honestly think it’s the best decision I've made in my life. The shift of priorities I had on this day led me to an exciting adventure that is actually just starting! Selling my stuff and moving to Spain was in fact the result of a bigger decision I made that day: I’m trying a new lifestyle based on new priorities.

Here are my new top 3 priorities:

1. Being location-independent
2. Avoiding routine and the 9-5
3. Getting out of my comfort zone as much as possible


##Why I decided to do this?

Why not? I like seeing people's reactions when I give this answer. A more appropriate answer would be: Because I felt it’s what would make me truly happy and I didn’t want to settle for anything less than that anymore.
What I have gained from doing this so far?

* I have made more friends in the last 2 months than in the past 2 years
* I have met incredibly interesting people from all around the world
* I realized that this lifestyle is truly possible and I can get better at it
* I learned once more that work done is way more important than time spent working
* It keeps me motivated to push myself and get more work done

##SEOCharles.com

I officially welcome you to my new website! Thanks to [Spektrum Media](http://www.spektrummedia.com/) for their amazing design and development work, you guys rock! This site is my new platform for my new lifestyle and will serves two purposes:

1. Showcase my services as an [SEO Consultant](http://www.seocharles.com/)
2. Share my new lifestyle experiences and hopefully inspire others at some point

##Why in English?

You might have noticed from my writing that English is not my first language. Or maybe because you know me personally… I decided to go for English because I feel I will be able to reach more people this way, and becoming 100% fluent in English is on my list of goals for 2012. I’m still a proud Québécois and most of the time I say I’m from Quebec before Canada. Unsurprisingly, most people outside Canada have no idea where Quebec is :)

What do you think about my new lifestyle and website?
