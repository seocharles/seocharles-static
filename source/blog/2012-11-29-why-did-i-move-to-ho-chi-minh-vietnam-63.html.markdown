I've received several questions lately about me being in Vietnam. Some came out of curiosity and others from people not understanding what I am doing here. The goal of this post is to answer these questions and give a better idea of what I am doing in here.

##Why Vietnam?

It can be summarized by "I just go where my gut tells me to go" but there are also rational reasons behind it:

**Location** - There are a lot of places I want to travel in and around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, China...). Vietnam is well located to be a base location to travel to these countries.

**The low cost of living** - I am tracking my expenses right now and I predict my cost of living here is around 30-40% lower than in Montreal. I could lower this even more if I wanted to. I just kept the same budget for some expenses like rent, but get more luxury, like a room with a private bathroom, balcony and maid service.

**Recommendations** - When my friend Ariane first talked to me about Vietnam, I wasn't trilled about the idea, especially after reading the [story of Matt](http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/why-ill-never-return-to-vietnam/). While in Spain, I happened to meet two guys living a similar lifestyle I'm pursuing who both raved about Vietnam. I’ve been here for three weeks and I cannot relate to Matt’s story at all. I thought maybe it was because I'm not into backpacking, but I have two friends currently doing a Vietnam backpacking trip and they seem to enjoy it a lot.

##What are you doing there?

Right now I'm focusing on growing my business and streams of income while discovering a new city and culture.

I spend a lot of time working in cafes, meeting a lot of new people, and trying new restaurants and food.

##How long are you going to stay?
My plan is no plan. I will stay as long as I feel like staying. Right now I think I will stay in Ho Chi Minh for a couple months.

##Why don't you post more pictures?

I just don't have many pictures to share right now. I'll probably be around Southeast Asia for a while, so there are no reasons for me to rush to travel everywhere. I am not in a picture-taking mode but more in a working mode right now.

Also, Facebook is blocked by many Internet provider here (requested by the government I think). It's a good thing for productivity but it complicates things a little to upload pictures. 

I will be taking a trip to Thailand and maybe Cambodia in December, so you can expect more pictures soon.

##Do they have good Internet connection in Vietnam?

In Ho Chi Minh it is slower than Canada in general, but I can really live with it. The worst places were about 1 Mbps and the best 8 Mbps download speed. For mobile, 3G with the iPhone is cheap and surprisingly fast (6 Mbps download, enough to make Skype calls).

##Did you have culture shock?
The first two days I did. One of the reasons I came here was to see something different, so I was prepared for it and looking forward to experiencing it.
There are a couple good reasons not to like Ho Chi Minh: crazy traffic and honking, air quality, smells, etc.

The second day I felt like I could either decide not to like the city for those reasons or give it a chance. Since then I have discovered a lot more about their culture and the lifestyle possibilities, which outweigh the cons for me.
