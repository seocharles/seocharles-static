They provide free quality articles to help musicians improve their ear and develop digital products like ear training apps, ebooks and courses.

##The Challenge

Despite having quality content and working on different site improvements, Easy Ear Training was experiencing a downward trend in organic traffic in the first half of 2013.

Seeing they were not ranking and receiving the organic traffic they deserved, they realized that great content isn’t enough and that they needed guidance to scale up the business through SEO.

##The Solution

Through an SEO diagnostic audit, I first identified every issue and opportunities and prioritized them.

We then worked together elaborating and implementing solutions to the most important on-site issues to benefit SEO, user experience and conversion.

Some of the areas we worked on:

* Overall site architecture
* Menu structure
* URLs Structure
* Internal links
* Indexing (canonical, noindex & 404)
* Content relevancy

Finally, I prepared a content and link development strategy to keep the upward organic traffic trend going. They are currently implementing it.

##The Results

Focusing on the on-site first allowed Easy Ear Training to build a strong foundation that will benefit their site for years and make every backlink count more.

Tackling their on-site SEO alone lead to a **140% increase in organic traffic and 177% increase in leads** within 3 months, numbers that are **still growing every week**.
