<i>“Life is like riding a bicycle (a motorbike in my case). To keep your balance you must keep moving.”</i> Albert Einstein

Outside all the excitement of moving to Vietnam over the last few weeks, I have at moments let myself feel down about the goals I didn't or know I won't be able to accomplish before the end of the year.

After I posted my list of goals on a previous post, several people told me (and I have to acknowledge) that my goals were pretty ambitious for the short deadline I had set.

I have always dreamed big and still believe I should, but I realize that it has made me unhappy a couple times in the past.

Dreaming big requires the ability to shrug off failures in a way that most people don't have naturally (myself included). I gave up several times when I shouldn't have after the first or second attempt failed.

First determining how bad you want something is a good indicator of what you’re ready to go through and if you should pursue it or not.

Looking back at the last six months, my successes all have one thing in common. All of them had these three questions answered clearly in my head and on paper:

* How bad I want this?
* Why I want this, what will I gain?
* What's the worst thing that can happen?

And then, for each of them I answered these questions (credit to [Tim Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) for most of this process):

What's the first action I could take today (tomorrow, day after tomorrow) to get me closer to my goal?

After failing a couple goals, I think it’s time to answer these questions again to see if I should keep pursuing them.

There are already 1-2 goals I don't think I should pursue right now but I think my ego and "what other people might think" is still affecting me, a bit... Yeah, I admitted that!

##Moving On...

Almost two weeks in Vietnam, really happy with the move! Ho Chi Minh is a pretty big and energetic city. The cost of living here is pretty cheap, the food is really good and I have already met great people who will most likely turn into good friends.

Wherever you go I believe meeting great people has such a huge impact on your experience and often makes the difference between liking a place or not.

Yesterday I found a room in what I would call a luxury house for just under $400/month. I think that settling here for a while will be perfect for growing my new business (more to come on that), getting work done for clients and traveling throughout Southeast Asia.

Writing about failures turned out to be more difficult than I thought—I deleted the first two posts I wrote because I didn't feel they were good enough. I will still try to write about it in the coming weeks and what I learned from it.

Anything in particular you'd like to read about my journey? Let me know in the comments!
