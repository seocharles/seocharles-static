One week left before going back to "normal life" in Vietnam. This trip in Thailand so far has been a great occasion to get out of intensive work mode, clear my mind, and reflect on the direction I want my life to take in 2013.

Traveling for about 30 hours of bus and boat rides between Bangkok and the different Thailand islands left me with a lot of time to do just that. I feel it was like therapy! And I have about 20 more hours waiting to go back to Bangkok and then Saigon.

When I think of my 2012 successes, I am really proud of what I accomplished and made happen. Here's a summary:

* I got rid of about 90% of my stuff
* I moved to Barcelona and started my location-independent journey
* I moved to Vietnam to experience Southeast Asia lifestyle
* I traveled in 4 new countries (Spain, Portugal, Vietnam and Thailand)
* I have become a more sociable person and met incredible people
* I significantly improved my productivity
* I got out of my comfort zone more than ever

##I failed

There are also failures I have endured and several goals that won't be accomplished before my New Year deadline. The numbers are actually a little shameful, but real. Out of the 15 [goals I set for the last quarter](http://www.seocharles.com/blog/a-goal-is-simply-a-dream-with-a-deadline), 3 were fully accomplished, 6 were given a "fair shot" or in progress, 1 made me realize I needed to make a change and drop the goal, and 5 will be total failures.

##What happened?

I started to doubt the importance of some of the goals and my capacity to accomplish them. Therefore I stopped committing myself to them and my attention shifted to other things. 

##Insights from 2012 successes and (especially) failures

1. **Stop beating myself up** <br />
I am becoming more and more aware of when it happens and how harmful beating myself up is. Regrets over past events, choices, or not being where I want to be just make the present worst.

2. **Stop overthinking and accomplish more** <br />
I'm often afraid of pursuing the wrong things, or not the optimal ones. It gets me into a thinking mode that paralyzes me from taking any action. The fact is it doesn't really matter, [making a decision and fully committing to it](http://youtu.be/H0mTXioA3Sc) is what matters.

3. **Define a clearer life plan** <br />
This is something I started to draft but I need to make it a lot clearer and organize it to determine where I want to be in 3-6 months and in 1-3-5-10-20 years.

4. **Let go of ego** <br />
I thought I knew about ego before reading [A New Earth](http://www.amazon.com/New-Earth-Awakening-Purpose-Selection/dp/0452289963) by Eckhart Tolle. This book makes you realize how negatively powerful ego is, why you should let it go and live in the present. I highly recommended it.

That said, I am now ready to kick in 2013 and make the most out of it!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!
